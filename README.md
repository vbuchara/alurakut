# ℹ️ Description

Gitkut is just like the old Orkut would be, it's a platform to share photos, videos and other contents to other people. Whether they are friends or participating in the same community, you can share all sort of contents and interact with all types of people and communities in this nostalgic social media 🌐  

This Application has been made during the "Imersão React 3a edição" event, with the help of Alura. The original aplication name was "Alurakut", I took my own personal changes and style through the development of Alurakut and have made the new application Gitkut ❗
